# README.MD
## Hello everyone, this is my `first` Github Repository ðŸš€
### In this process, I'll record what code experience I can gain from my leetcode exercise, which I shedule it `5 days a week` ðŸ˜ƒ
### The content include
>[!CAUTION]
>### How can I solid my python basis, especially those `common and frequent issues` in coding

>[!NOTE]
>### Every leetcode I've done I'll `upload it` and record at least one `revise version`(new idea? more efficient method?)

>[!TIP]
>### Any new idea, especially for the `math problem`, I will record it for further use!!


## So, let us progress togather!!ðŸ˜˜
